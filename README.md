### Steps for Postgre DB integration : 
 <p>
 </br>
1. Add conenction properties for our postgre DB running locally
 </br>
 </br>
2. We need annotations to our POJO class to specify that our class will act like and entity.
   </br>
   We need to add annotations which will also tell JPA taht my entity have a primary key and colums.
   </br>
   It may so happen that your class property name and your DB columns names may different. EG. @Emtoty ,@Id
 </br>
 </br>
3. We need to add a special interface which inherits from JPARepository interface, which will proovide all the runtime           
   capabilities (CURDQ - Create, Update, Read, Delete, Query).
 </br>
 </br>
4. Replace hardcoded data in our service class with Read DB Operations.

## Spring Boot + PostgreSQL + UUID String
</br>

Itâ€™s easy to use UUID String as Primary Key when you are using PostgreSQL database.
</br>
To archive this, just configure your Entity to use UUID2 generator.
</br>

```java

@Id
@GenericGenerator(name = "uuid2", strategy = "uuid2")
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY, generator = "uuid2")
@Column(length = 36, nullable = false, updatable = false)
private String id;

```

What is App router 
</br>
- [X] It is a Node JS Application
- [X] it is used to aautomate the process of authentication, authorization with XSUAA to do token exchange
- [X] it sits in the middle of idp (identity provider) and XSUAA, it will redirect the request to our micorservice to XSUAA and eventually to IDP.
- [X] IDP sends the login screen to the user, user authenticates, which is taken to XSUAA, XSUAA issues JWT token(java authnticated web token), this JWT token is presented to api end points.
- [X] App router takes th JWT token from XSUAA and give ir ro our microservices and even exchange this token to multiple microservices inside.
- [X] it serves as a single entry point for entire app.

</br>
App router is an application which does internal communciations between micro services to give single entry point for user it communicates to XSUAA to get access tokens.

</br>
</br>
</br>

What is XSUAA
</br>
</br>
Extensibility services for user access authorizations which is responsible for authorization to access the BTP services
